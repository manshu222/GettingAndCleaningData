## CODE BOOK

This Code book contains the documentation of the code that you certainly will not read.

The original dataset is UCI HAR dataset taken from some Samsung Smartwatch by different subjects in different positions.

## Data variables

In the final tidy dataset, the following variables are taken into consideration:
 [1] "Activity"                             "Subjects"                            
 [3] "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"                    "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"

A person should know the units of these variables by themselves otherwise don't bother studying data science. (JK)
